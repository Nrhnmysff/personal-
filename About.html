                <p style="text-align: center; color:white">Introducing my name Nor Hanum binti Yusoff. The 4th child of
                     four siblings. Originally from Kelantan and a 2nd semester student majoring in computing, 
                     informatics and mathematics at UITM Kelantan, Machang campus. By venturing into this field of study, 
                     I successfully faced challenges and always looked for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills 
                     in this subject. My academic journey has been complemented by practical experience, such as the 
                     research work I have participated in. Apart from academics, I am also actively involved in curricular
                    activities, clubs and organizations. This experience has not only enriched my university life but has 
                    also helped me develop valuable teamwork, leadership and communication skills.</p>
